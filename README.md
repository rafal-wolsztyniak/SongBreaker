# Hello,  SFMC Developers!

This is a repository for the solution that won in the Efficiency category on [HowToSFMC](https://www.howtosfmc.com/posts/one-more-time-winners-announced/) which was described as follows:

>> Efficiency: The challenge lyrics are 2303 characters long, and your job is to find the least amount of characters necessary in SSJS to output these lyrics. This challenge will be measured solely via the character count. We will be utilizing https://www.charactercountonline.com/ to count the characters in your submission.

In this repository you'll find 3 files:
- `00 - SongBreaker` 
   - This is a page that generates the code for the words and structure strings

- `02 - Optimized After the Submission - 664 characters`
